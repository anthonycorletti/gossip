1. [Using](#using)
2. [Building](#building)
3. [Testing and Hacking](#testing-and-hacking)
4. [Notable Make Commands](#notable-make-commands)

## Goals
1. Reduce heartbeat rate if window not visible.
2. "Hide screen" when window visible for too long (AFK protection).
3. Cleaner input area.
4. Regularly replace timestamp with relative timestamps (about 3 minutes, 2 days, etc).
5. All navigation done through simple nav bar.
	* rooms/options are _'bootstrap breadcrumbs'_ that drop down or something
		* {Gossip} / {organization | group} / {room | whisper}
	* people in users list are links to start PM session
		* {meta-key}+click may @mention someone in the current channel
6. IRC-style commands
7. Off-The-Record
8. All the __good__ and __thought out__ encryption I can muster.
9. Only keep last X messages -- scrolling loads more.
10. Quickselect -- potentially on holding of a meta key;
	* Use something like [this](http://creative-punch.net/2014/02/making-animated-radial-menu-css3-javascript/)
	* Link to most recent and/or popular:
		1. People/ private rooms
		2. Rooms
		3. Groups
11. Search


## Using

__TODO: Mongo documentation__

### From Source
First, read the [building](#building) section. It will illustrate how to:

1. [Install Dependencies](#dependencies)
2. [Build the Binary and Client](#building-application)

Then decide whether you want to:

1. [Run Locally](#locally)
2. [Run In a Virtual Machine](#ec2)

### From Binaries
Coming soon lol ...

### Running
Now that we've got everything built/installed let's run the thing.

#### Locally
To run the server on the machine you built/downloaded on:

	make run

This also requires a `Mongo` database be running on the system.

Assuming no changes were made to the `Vagrantfile` the application will be accessible at:

	http://192.168.20.20

#### EC2
Coming soon... done in `Vagrant`.


## Building
Much of the building and installation is done via `make`. There are a few prereqs.

### Prerequisites
The following are requisites only for building. They are hard dependencies for it, however.

1. The primary development language is [Go](http://golang.org/)
2. Development of the reference client aided by [node](http://nodejs.org)

All secondary libraries, utilities, and actions are installed by the `make` commands.

	make deps

Do note that the `node` requirement may be expanded or completely removed. I am open to suggestions or pull requests on this matter.

For a list of what dependencies are used:

1. Go: `/deps.json`
2. node: `/package.json`

### Steps
If all hard dependencies met, a simple `make install` will do. For sanity's sake, I'll describe the whole process. It is two parts.

### Dependencies
1. Install `go`:
	* Debian/Ubuntu/etc: `apt-get install golang`
	* MacOSX:
		* __[brew](http://brew.sh/)__: `brew install go`
		* __without brew__: follow the [go site](http://golang.org) instructions
2. Install `node`:
	* Debian/Ubuntu/etc: `apt-get install nodejs`
	* MacOSX:
		* __[brew](http://brew.sh/)__: `brew install node`
		* __without brew__: follow the [node site](http://nodejs.org) instructions

### Building Application
Now, to build the binary and client, simply run:

1. `make`
2. `make install`
	* binary installation directory set by `$PREFIX`
		* __inline__: `PREFIX=/my/install/dir make install`

The default `make` target will pull secondary dependencies, compile the binary, and generate distribution client code.

Intuitively, `make install` installs the binary into a globally executable location and the client into a servable directory.

## Testing & Hacking
In the root directory you will find a `Vagrantfile` and an `ansible/` directory.

[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) provides easy creation of machine environments using a variety of providers but most natable Virtualbox and EC2.

[Ansible](http://ansible.com) is a tool that allows easy provisioning of machines generated by Vagrant or some other means. Simply point it a single or set of boxes and let her rip.

### Local
To start a local environment make sure you have [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed.

Once this is done, simply run:

	make local

### Remote
Still working on this ...


## Notable Make Commands
This list does not contain all the commands. It is meant to highlight the important ones.

### default -- happens on a bare `make`
* Does a "sum-total" build of the server binary and client.
* It __does not__ attempt to install it, however.

### deps
* Install all secondary dependencies for `go` and `node`

### binary
* Only build the server -- go portion of the codebase

### client
* Build the reference client into the ouput directory

### clean
* Remove intermediate files and built directory

### install
* Debian-focused, though should work on most *nices or BSDs
	* verified on `Ubuntu 14.04` and `MacOSX 10.9`
* Install the binary to the `$PREFIX` directory
	* if none supplied, `/usr/local/bin` is used
* Install the client to `/srv/gossip`
	* this __will__ be made variable soon

### local
* Build a local test environment using [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and [Ansible]	(http://ansible.com).

### run
* Run the server on the machine issuing the command
* Will build the system first
